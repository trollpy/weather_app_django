## üöÄ Enabling the Forecast Feature

To enable the 5-day forecast feature that's included in the UI, you'll need to modify your Django views to fetch forecast data. Add this to your `views.py`:

```python
def index(request):
    # Existing view code...
    
    # For forecast data
    forecast_data = None
    if weather_data:
        # Get city coordinates from weather_data
        lat = weather_data['coord']['lat']
        lon = weather_data['coord']['lon']
        
        # Call OpenWeatherMap 5-day forecast API
        forecast_url = f'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&units=metric&appid={settings.OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY}'
        
        try:
            forecast_response = requests.get(forecast_url)
            forecast_response.raise_for_status()
            forecast_json = forecast_response.json()
            
            # Process forecast data (one entry per day)
            forecast_data = []
            added_dates = set()
            
            for item in forecast_json['list']:
                date = item['dt_txt'].split(' ')[0]
                
                # Only add one forecast per day
                if date not in added_dates:
                    forecast_data.append({
                        'date': datetime.strptime(date, '%Y-%m-%d').strftime('%a'),  # Day name
                        'temp': round(item['main']['temp']),
                        'icon': item['weather'][0]['icon'],
                        'description': item['weather'][0]['description']
                    })
                    added_dates.add(date)
                
                # Stop after 5 days
                if len(forecast_data) >= 5:
                    break
        except:
            forecast_data = None
    
    context = {
        'form': form,
        'weather_data': weather_data,
        'forecast_data': forecast_data,  # Add to context
        'error_message': error_message,
        'recent_searches': recent_searches
    }
    
    # Don't forget to add this import at the top:
    # from datetime import datetime
```

## üìù Customization Options

### Changing the Sky Animation
You can modify the sky gradient colors in the CSS by editing the `@keyframes sky-color-change` section:

```css
@keyframes sky-color-change {
    0% { background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #87CEEB, #B0E0E6); } /* Day */
    25% { background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #FFA07A, #FFD700); } /* Sunset */
    50% { background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #4B0082, #000080); } /* Night */
    75% { background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #FF69B4, #FFA07A); } /* Sunrise */
    100% { background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #87CEEB, #B0E0E6); } /* Back to day */
}
```

### Adding More Cloud Elements
You can generate additional clouds by modifying the JavaScript function:

```javascript
// Increase the number of clouds
for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {  // Change from 3 to 6
    createCloud(i);
}
```

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- **Animated Weather Icons**: Add movement to weather icons based on conditions
- **Sound Effects**: Optional ambient sounds matching the weather (rain, thunder, etc.)
- **User Accounts**: Save favorite cities and personalize the experience
- **Weather Alerts**: Notifications for severe weather conditions
- **Show weather forecast too** 
- **Multiple Cities**: Compare weather between different locations
- **Historical Data**: View and graph past weather patterns
- **Weather Maps**: Interactive radar and satellite imagery
